## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to solidify the mathematical thinking that underlies these algorithms. While the implementation is not novel and is not interesting in it of itself, it provides a good learning opportunity beyond merely reciting the notes. In addition, this project will also provide a good opportunity to instill solid engineering generality into the library.
## Sort Implementations
The library includes algorithms for the following sorts:

 -  Selection Sort
-   Insertion Sort
-   Shell Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Quicksort
